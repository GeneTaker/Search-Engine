The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue across the vast ocean. Waves crashed against the jagged rocks, their rhythmic sound echoing in the cool evening air. A gentle breeze rustled through the tall grass that lined the cliffside, as birds soared high above, silhouetted against the fading light. In the distance, a lone sailboat drifted slowly, its sails billowing in the wind, while the sky transitioned from shades of orange to deep purple. It was a moment of tranquility, one that made the world seem both immense and small at once.
