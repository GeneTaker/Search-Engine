### Search-Engine
First attempt at a project

## Overview:
- This project is a search engine that works with a small self-injected data set of files using custom file handling
- It is capable of providing users a means of searching and viewing these files via a command line interface

## Tech Stack:
- This project was created entirely in Java, with use of OOP design principles

## Features:
- Indexing and tokenising documents
- Boolean search query evaluation (the search engine is capable of AND, OR and NOT logical operations)
- Handling search queries
- Search result ranking (BM25 ranking)
- Can handle larger datasets (due to use of efficient data structures)

## Running the Program
To run the program, feel free to clone the repository by running

>> git clone https://github.com/GeneTaker/Search-Engine.git

and running the program from App.java

## Design Notes:
For notes on how this project was designed, please refer to __blog.md__

## Future Considerations:
- This project could be extended and scaled by integrating Lucene into it
